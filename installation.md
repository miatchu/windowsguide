# Installation

The Installation is pretty selfexplanatory, when reaching the OOBE (Out-of-box experience), setup your Region, keyboard layout and Network-config, at Account setup an Offline account and deny any crap until your asked how/if you want to customize your device skip it and choose Required at the diagnosics settings.

That's it.

If your using a freshly bought device that has not been setup before than don't use the oem preinstall and do a fresh install via an [offical iso](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/windows10) + [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/).&#x20;
