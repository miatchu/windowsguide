# Overview

This was last ritten for Win 10 22H2.

Use Windows 10 Pro not Win 10 Home, because heaps features are missing, also please [don't use Windows 11](https://www.windowscentral.com/one-thing-microsoft-didnt-discuss-windows-11-privacy).

Most of this is stolen from [Federico Dossena's Guide](https://fdossena.com/?p=w10debotnet%2Findex\_1903.frag) on this topic, but some things are stolen from ahother [people](miscellaneous/sources.md), and some are even edited by me for the version this was last ritten for and with a little bit of piracy sprinkled with in. Now with that out of the way:

THIS (largely) CANNOT BE REVERTED WITHOUT AN REINSTALL!

Only follow this guide if want more privacy or more better memory usage.
